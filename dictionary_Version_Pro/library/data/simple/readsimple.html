<br><font color=red>Draft of May 21, 2008</font></font></H3>
<font face="arial,helvetica,non-serif">
<br><b>Toolbox Files included:</b>
<ul>          readsimple.html &nbsp;  13KB &nbsp; (this note)
<br>SIMPLE.dic &nbsp; &nbsp; 44KB &nbsp;- the simple English spell checking dictionary.
<br>SIMPLE.aff	 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3KB &nbsp;- the Simple English affix file (suffixes) Same as en_US.aff.
		-commonwealth users may chose to us en_GB.aff.
<br>dictionary.lst &nbsp; &nbsp; 2KB &nbsp;- list of languages available on your PC.

</ul>
<b>Purpose:</b>
<br>Provide a spell checking filter for use as Simple English by use with the free Open Office software suite.    The vocabulary of
Simple English is composed of Basic English (1500) plus 
the most frequent 1000 words in English.  This page addresses the technical issues and electronic
office aids to try to help writers using Simple English.

<br><br> &nbsp; &nbsp;  
<b><a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">OpenOffice.org</a></b> is similar to M$-Office , except it is  freeware, world wide, localized to many langauges,  with one million downloads in the last 4 months (MS-Office has about 1.8 paying customers). OOo is a large file (95MB), or it may be ordered as a CD from one of their
<a href="http://www.openoffice.org/dev_docs/source/download.html#cdroms">partners.</a> We paid $5.50 for a copy.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; We assume you have acquired, installed and are familiar
with Open Office text processing. It is similar to M$-Word, but not exactly the same.  You should practice changing between the multiple langauges built-in to OOo --French, German, etc.



<br><br><b>TO SETUP Simple English spell checker:</b>
<br>UnZip Simple.zip into a temporary folder.
<br>Copy <b>SIMPLE.dic ,
<ul>SIMPLE.aff ,</b> &nbsp; and
<br><b>dictionary.lst </b> &nbsp;
into the file where you have OpenOffice.org shared dictionaries.  This folder is probably:
<br>C:\Program Files\OpenOffice.org 2.4\share\dict\ooo .
If not, search to find en_US.dic and that will be the directory to copy these three files.
<br>(These instructions are the same as for Basic English (en_BE.dic) for those familar with that spell checking.)
<br>We have to fool Open Office to use of Simple English and pretend it is an
international language known to OpenOffice.org.  We have chosen to pretend
that Simple English is the English dialect of Zimbabwe, en_ZW.
</ul>
<br>Start up Open Office and tell it you have a new language.
<ul>	Select Tools from the top line.
<br>	Select Options from the bottom of the drop dowmnmenu. 
<br>	Click on Language Settings
<br>	Select Languge Aids
<ul>		Under User-Defined Dictionaires, Select <font color=green>New</font>.
<br>		Enter name : <font color="#006600"><b>Simple</b></font>	
<br>		Select Langauge from list:  <font color="#006600">English (Zimbabawe)</font>
<br>		Put a check mark in front of SIMPLE[English(Zimbabwe)]
<br>		Click OK.  (only once)
</ul>	You have finished adding a new language to Open Office.
<br>	Click on Languages.  
	<ul>If starting over, repeat steps 1-3, then select Languages.</ul>
<br>	Go to the line : Default language for Documents.
<ul>		On the line &nbsp; Western -- Select  English (Zimbabwe).  Note that it is now
		available to you with spell checking.
<br>		IF you intend Simple English to be used only occationally,
		then select For this Document Only for testing now and you will
	 	repeat the Language step whenever you want to use Simple English
		(Zimbabwe) spell checking. 
<br>		IF you want Simple English to be your major language, then leave unchecked [ &nbsp; ]  For this Document Only and your default langauge on Open Office Write will be Simple English. 
<br>Look at Options box on the bottom of that page and be sure that
these are <b>NOT marked.</b> 
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; [&nbsp;  ] "Check in all languages"
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; [&nbsp;  ] "Do not mark errors".
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Click <font color="#009900">OK</font>
<br>Close OpenOffice.  It must be restarted to see your new language.
</ul></ul>

<br><b>TO USE:</b>
<ul>	Start OpenOffice.org
<br>	Select Tools on top line
<br>	Select Language from near the top of the drop down menu.
<br>	Select For Text from pop up menu
<br>	Select English (Zimbabwe) from list.
</ul>	

<br><br><b>TO UNINSTALL :</b>
<br>There are no registry entries.  Simply delete or don't use any features
that are no longer wanted.  All three files are simple text files, nothing is hidden.

<H3 style="color:#993300">DISCUSSION</h3>
<b>Simple English -- What is included in this version ?</b>
<b>Basic 1500.</b>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Every learner of Basic English is expected to know the 850 words, 
the international words, six affixes (suffixes and prefixes) and complex words, plus
one area of General interest with 100 words, such as Science, Business,
or Verse; These are all included.  <font color="#666666">Each learner also has one detailed special word list of 50 words, after that General topic of 100 words,
such as Biology, Economics, or Bible. These are NOT included in Simple English. </font>  The originators of Basic also provide
a learning path beyond basic Basic of 150 First Suppliment words of common plants, animals and foods and 350 Subsequent words at
which point the learner should be able to continue at his own pace.  These ARE included in Simple.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Basic English is a full language for general living
and works as an auxiliary international language.  The limited vocabulary allows
quick learning -- weeks, not years.  Obviously it is an excellent first step in learning
full English because it allows almost immediate immersion into daily English-speaking life.
Note, Basic English is a subset of Standard English with simple rules of grammar -- there is
NO unlearning required to progress to full English. 

<br>Review :  There is no standard for the vocabulary of  Simple English.  We have included Basic English at the 1500 word level.  This is the 850, 50 international, 50 measures, 350 subsequent, 250 general.
<font color="#3f3f3f">The "First Supplement 150" words has not been found -- they are words of common
animals, plants, and foods.  If found. they will be added, else a <a href="http://ogden.basic-english.org/next150.html" target=0>good guess</a> is being worked on.</font>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; These lists overlap to large degree and the Simple English versions make an attempt to remove duplicates.  
<br> 
<br><b>Most Frequently Used Words in English</b>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; The
48 of most frequently used 50 words in English are Basic ,  82 of the next 100 , and 63 of the next 100 are in Basic.
[ Source is General Service List used by Longman and others. Other lists exist and usage changes over time, but the lists are similar.  None include the very frequent - <i>"aah, ya'no."</i>]
Just for fun, here are the first 300 words that are not Basic. 
<ul>|001-100| &nbsp; <i>can/could , know.
<br>|101-200| &nbsp;  think, find, must, should, just, tell, leave, few, ask,
follow, during , hold, around, consider, problem, plan, stand ,course. 
<br>|201-300| &nbsp; city, close, unite, bring , try, provide, continue, pay, study, until,.
service, report, toward, figure, return,  include, yet, big, expect, car, several, matter, usual, rather, per, often, action.</i>
</ul> 
<font color="#333333"><b>&#86;OA Special English</b> -- &#86;OA SE is a valuable resource for learners to hear English in an easy, always available form.  <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Half of &#86;OA SE words are Basic. The other words are special for international
news. They do not make a full language for daily living or work.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Some like to add <b>&#86;OA Special English</b> as part of Simple English, most noteably Simple Wikipedia.  If that is what you want, we provide a complete Simple WIKI English download that adds &#86;OA SE words to Simple that may be downloaded.  Do not download this Simple English.  The WIKI.zip download is a larger file and contain the options discussed later.
 
<br><br><b>DETAILS.</b>
<br><b>Business</b> - 84 root words -- expand to 307 with derivatives and compounds.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; 	In the area of Business, two Specialty lists
are provided, each is fifty words, one for Commerce (trade) and one for
Economics, but not one for general Business.  Together they should
provide the learner with one hundred general business
words, but the lists overlap 16 words, so that the combined list
is only 84 words.  These words are included.  the number expands to 307 words with derivatives and compound words.

<br><b>Science.</b> &nbsp; 100 root words - common to the sciences.
These words are included.  We DO NOT include the speciality words for
<ul>&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Biology.</b> &nbsp; 50 words
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Geology.</b> &nbsp; 50 words
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Mathematics &amp; Mechanics.</b> &nbsp; 50 words
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Physics-Chemistry.</b> &nbsp; 50 words.
</ul>
<b>Verse .</b> &nbsp; 100 root words -- common to literature and poetry.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; The only specialty under Verse is Bible - 50 words, is not included, but is available separately.
<br><b>Social Science .</b> &nbsp; 22 root words -- 14 General , 3 Economics , 5 Political Science
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; You will remember that Florence has added social senses to existing Basic English words.  
Only 22 of the 100 social science words are new. There are no
true sub-lists. The 22 words are included.

<br><br><b>Subsequent Words (next words after basic Basic) .</b> &nbsp; 350 root words
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Although not part of Basic, the same techniques were used to
determine the next words to be learned by the learner going forward to full English.
These words meet the goals of Simple English Wiki and all are included. 
The Next 150 words for common foods, plants and animals will be added when found or a good guess will be provided.

&nbsp; &nbsp; One additional file may make life easier.  This is the Proper Noun, or Capitalized Words, list.  All proper nouns (capitalized names) are allowed in any language.  Open Office spell checking underlines all non-Simple English words with a red line.
Because no Capitalized words are included, then every capitalized word will be flagged as non-Simple.   We have not included the very large Capitalized word
list to make our development work easlier with the smaller file. The file is large, for example, because it contains at least ten international spellings of the name Alice.  We may eventually include the Proper Nouns in the SIMPLE file.
<br><br>
<b>MORE THAN YOU NEED TO KNOW:</b>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; The three files you copied into Open Office are:
<ul><b>SIMPLE.dic</b>	This is the spell checking word list for Simple English.
<br><b>SIMPLE.aff</b>	This is a feature to make the software more efficient.
<br>(discuss more about affixes in readsimplemore.html? )
<br><b>dictionary.lst</b> contains a list of all dictionaries that OpenOffice is capable of using.  We have added:  en_BZ (Basic English) and en_ZW (Simple English) as dialects of English.  Also included are en_JM for Basic 1500 (not available, yet.)  And en_GH for Wiki English (with VOA added).
</ul><br>Note : The three files used here are simple text files that can be read and edited with any simple text editor.  
<br>You will want to <b>add</b> your name, street, organization, other names of your interest
to the SIMPLE.dic file after you have tested the process.  <br>If you add a lot of
words, then update the line count on the first line.    <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Spelling is case sensitive.
